project_summary: "Many hands make 'lite' work goes the saying. That is the motto of the liteArm project, to create a common format robotic arm that can be used as a platform for the community to build off of. It was designed to be 3D Printable, and to run off of an arduino uno (plus shields)."

  <li>The LiteArm i1 Robot Arm Structure (24 parts, 3D Printable)</li>
</ul>
<h2>About</h2>
The liteArm was reverse engineered from another project named uArm, created by uFactory, a small company in China, that funded itself thru a Kickstarter. uFactory took a very long time to post updates, did not send out product on time, and was late in open-sourcing their materials. All of this created the perfect environment perfect for the creation of an alternate open-source robot arm. Enter - the liteArm.<br /><br />

According to the original creator of the liteArm 3D models:
<blockquote style="margin-top:5px;">"The Lite Arm is different in many ways than the uArm, one of those changes is in rectifying the 'side wobble'  the others are reinforcements and cosmetic design changes that are only possible to be constructed in 3D printing and CNC." - Armatec Group</blockquote>

The uArm itself was based off of other well-known industrial robot arms. So, all that said, it's an open-source robot arm - desktop sized, and modeled after real industrial robot arms.<br /><br />Credit:
