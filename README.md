# Nortbotics
This is the Nortbotics eCommerce site. Originally based off of 'Jekyll Incorporated', it has been highly customized and edited. I found that no other Jekyll users had tried to do eCommerce - so ended up figuring much of it out on my own. It's not anything special, just a lot of common sense I think. I have much more to do, but I think this is a good start - so why not opensource it and let others use it. 

See this theme being put to use at [Nortbotics.com](http://www.Nortbotics.com)

## Installation & Usage
    bundle install
    jekyll serve --watch

_Note: Requires Ruby version 1.9.3 =>. For example use [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)_   
    
## Configuration
Edit: _config.yml (general options), main.css (theme colors &amp; fonts)

```
root/
├── _config.yml
├── _assets/
    ├── stylesheets/

_Note: when editing _config.yml, you need to restart jekyll to see the changes.__
